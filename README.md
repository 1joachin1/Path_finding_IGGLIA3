Our project consists in managing the rapid movement in the city center of Antananarivo through the shortest way
using Moore Dijkstra's algorithm. We approximated the data because we didn't have a lot of information
therefore they are not exact yet. This application is carried out by HTML/CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
Finally, it is an honor to work on this project because it gives us a lot of
knowledge and experience.
